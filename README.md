# Kmer.NET

A .NET/C# implementation and translation of [ridgelab/Kmer-SSR](https://github.com/ridgelab/Kmer-SSR)

# System Requirements

1. For building and running Kmer.NET.CLI, your Windows/macOS/Linux device should support .NET 6. <br /> System requirements are [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/supported-os.md);
2. For building and running Kmer.NET.Windows, your Windows device should support Windows App SDK. <br /> System requirements are [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/system-requirements#windows-app-sdk).

# Notes

1. For some reasons the "Browse file" buttons in Kmer.NET.Windows are not enabled, we could make a fix later as Windows App SDK gets updated;
2. Test code and sample input/output data will be provided later.
